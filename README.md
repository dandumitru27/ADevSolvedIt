## A Dev Solved It

Website for programmers to share solutions to their software development problems.

Supports editing with Markdown, a thank-you mechanism, a comments system, and easy authentication.

It's developed in .NET 8 (C#, ASP.NET Razor Pages, Entity Framework), with a bit of JavaScript, and it uses a SQL Server database.

It was online at ADevSolvedIt.com for a few years, where me and a few other users posted 28 solutions. In the end, it didn't get enough traction, and it also didn't help that programmers started using Gen AI instead of going to programming websites.

I exported the posts in Markdown format and they are here in this repo: [28 posts](/export)
